                <p>
                    The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to
                    the smallest particles of debris – in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and
                    Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is
                    special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.

                <p>
                    Earth—our home planet—is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s
                    inhabited by living things. It's also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the
                    surface.

                <h3>The Moon</h3>
                <p>
                    Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. The Moon makes Earth a more
                    livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable
                    climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.
