                        As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer, some of the colors are
                        scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles, changing the final color of
                        the beam the viewer sees. Because the shorter wavelength components, such as blue and green,
                        scatter more strongly, these colors are preferentially removed from the beam. At sunrise and
                        sunset, when the path through the atmosphere is longer, the blue and green components are
                        removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues we see at those
                        times. The remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other
                        relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange. The removal of the
                        shorter wavelengths of light is due to Rayleigh scattering by air molecules and particles much
                        smaller than the wavelength of visible light (less than 50 nm in diameter). The
                        scattering by cloud droplets and other particles with diameters comparable to or larger than the
                        sunlight's wavelengths (> 600 nm) is due to Mie scattering and is not strongly
                        wavelength-dependent. Mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds, and also
                        for the daytime halo of white light around the Sun (forward scattering of white
                        light).

                        Sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors, because the evening air contains
                        more particles than morning air. Sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a green flash can
                        be seen.

                        Ash from volcanic eruptions, trapped within the troposphere, tends to mute sunset and sunrise
                        colors, while volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the stratosphere (as thin clouds of
                        tiny sulfuric acid droplets), can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called afterglows and
                        pre-sunrise glows. A number of eruptions, including those of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and Krakatoa
                        in 1883, have produced sufficiently high stratus clouds containing sulfuric acid to yield
                        remarkable sunset afterglows (and pre-sunrise glows) around the world. The high altitude clouds
                        serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset, down
                        to the surface.

                        Some of the most varied colors at sunset can be found in the opposite or eastern sky after the
                        Sun has set during twilight. Depending on weather conditions and the types of clouds present,
                        these colors have a wide spectrum, and can produce unusual results.
