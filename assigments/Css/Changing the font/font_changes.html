                <p>
                    In composition, a title is a word or phrase given to a text (an essay, article, chapter, report, or
                    other work) to identify the subject, attract the reader's attention, and forecast the tone and
                    substance of the writing to follow.

                    A title may be followed by a colon and a subtitle, which usually amplifies or focuses the idea
                    expressed in the title.

                <h2>I'm a subtitle</h2>
                <p>
                    Subtitles are text representing the contents of the audio in a film, television show, opera or other
                    audiovisual media. Subtitles might provide a transcription or translation of spoken dialogue.
                    Although naming conventions can vary, captions are subtitles that include written descriptions of
                    other elements of the audio like music or sound effects. Captions are thus especially helpful to
                    people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Subtitles may also add information that is not present in
                    the audio. Localizing subtitles provide cultural context to viewers. For example, a subtitle could
                    be used to explain to an audience unfamiliar with sake that it is a type of Japanese wine. Lastly,
                    subtitles are sometimes used for humor, as in Annie Hall, where subtitles show the characters' inner
                    thoughts, which contradict what they were saying in the audio.
